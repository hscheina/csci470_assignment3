Assignment three for cs470
by: Haley Scheina && Alonso Arteaga

todos: 
* ~~complete main.java~~
* complete Drawgui.java
    * add comments to private variable declarations for neatness
    * **gui is not redrawing after it draws the first time.
        clicking on 'get albums', changing settings, and clicking
        get album, does nothing.**
            
            * expected behavior: clicking 'getAlbum' should fetch a new xml string and redraw the frame with the updated xml contents
    * fix the radio button selection issue, probably with listeners         
                
* ~~complete XMLDownloadTask.java~~
* ~~complete AlbumHandler.java~~
* ~~complete Album.java~~
